    <div class="text">
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures the content by using tags like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML forms the backbone of every website and allows developers to build a webpage layout. Elements such as `div`, `a`, `p`, and `img` are used to define the structure and content. HTML works alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality. It's essential for frontend development and is supported by all web browsers. HTML5 is the latest version and supports multimedia, semantic elements, and improved performance.

    <div class="text">
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design HTML elements on a webpage. It controls layout, colors, fonts, spacing, animations, and responsiveness. CSS allows you to separate design from content, making your code cleaner and easier to manage. There are three types: Inline, Internal, and External CSS. CSS3 is the latest version, supporting features like media queries, transitions, and flexbox. It enables websites to look professional and work well on all devices. Without CSS, web pages would appear plain and unstyled. It's a core skill in frontend development.

    <div class="text">
      Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework developed by Twitter. It helps developers build responsive and mobile-first websites quickly using pre-designed components like buttons, forms, modals, and navigation bars. Bootstrap includes a grid system for layout and works well with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It saves development time and ensures consistency in design. You can use Bootstrap by including its CDN or downloading its files. It also supports customization and works across all modern browsers. Bootstrap 5 is the latest version, offering better performance and no dependency on jQuery.

    <div class="heading">What is JavaScript?</div>
    <div class="text">
      JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive and dynamic. It allows you to create features like image sliders, form validations, pop-ups, and real-time updates. JavaScript runs in the browser and works with HTML and CSS. It can also interact with APIs and perform tasks without reloading the page. Modern JavaScript includes ES6+ features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and promises. Libraries like jQuery and frameworks like React and Angular are built on JavaScript. It's essential for frontend development and widely used in backend development with Node.js too.

    <div class="heading">What is React JS?</div>
    <div class="text">
      React JS is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It uses a component-based structure, allowing developers to create reusable UI elements. React uses a virtual DOM, which improves performance by updating only the parts of the UI that change. It supports hooks for managing state and side effects. JSX, a syntax extension, allows HTML-like code within JavaScript. React is widely used for developing interactive and scalable web apps. With strong community support, React is one of the most popular tools in modern frontend development.
